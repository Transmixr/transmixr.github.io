# Volumetric Content Toolbox

## Overview

The Volumetric Content Toolbox is a workflow that shows how volumetric image and video technologies are used to create interactive XR experiences. 
The workflow was created and tested in collaboration with journalists by the example of a VR reportage on the annual ski jumping event of Planica valley in Slovenia.


### What problems does it solve?

Creation of interactive immersive experiences based on real spaces.

### How does it work?

The workflow includes both postprocessing and static 3D reconstruction from recordings of a real-world scene. Image or video material is color-corrected and creatively adjusted according to a desired visual outcome. Video material can be split into individual frames before reconstruction. The reconstruction step involves Structure from Motion and reconstruction through 3D Gaussian Splatting.

With the right plugins, Gaussian splatting assets (volumetric images) and volumetric video can be brought together into one Unity 3D application.
