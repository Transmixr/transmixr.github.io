## Where does it fit in TRANSMIXR?

The Media Understanding & Selection toolbox provides tools for asset management and transformation. Media corporations that already possess media assets such as image and video can use the media understanding and selection workflows to integrate their content into immersive story-telling applications.


## What problems does it solve?

1. Manage video content (2d, volumetric)
2. Repurpose content for various production environments
3. Analyze content and provide insight

## How does it work?

The pipeline collects accessible digital content in the form of data items via a Web crawler or the API. Each item is processed in the pipeline in three ways:

1. Extracting and cleaning raw content from the item;
2. Extracting or creating technical metadata for the item; and
3. Determining the descriptive metadata for the item (NLP, NER and NEL components for keyword and entity detection).
