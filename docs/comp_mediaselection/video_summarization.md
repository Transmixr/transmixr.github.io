# Video Summarization

## Overview

The CERTH Video Summarization Service is an online interactive tool that addresses the challenge of manually editing and adapting videos for various social media platforms. It automatically generates concise, shareable summaries from user-submitted videos in multiple formats. The service includes interactive steps that allow users to adjust the algorithm’s selected summaries and aspect ratios with just a few clicks, streamlining the editing process while giving users control over the final output.

### What problem does it solve?

The Video Summarization Service solves the problem of time-consuming and technically demanding video editing for social media. Creating platform-specific video summaries typically requires manual trimming, resizing, and highlight selection—tasks that are inefficient and often require editing expertise. This service automates the summarization process and provides intuitive tools for quick adjustments, making it easy for users to produce optimized, engaging video content for different social media channels with minimal effort.

### How does it work

Users submit a video either by sharing its URL or uploading a local file. They select the desired social media platform, such as Instagram or Twitter, each with specific duration and aspect ratio requirements. The service then generates a summary tailored to the chosen platform, allowing users to apply summarization edits, aspect ratio adjustments, or both. Through an interactive interface, users can easily refine the summary and layout to better fit their needs.
