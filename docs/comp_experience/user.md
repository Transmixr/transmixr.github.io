The User is the role intended for end users, or spectators, to view the final broadcast and interact with each other. Like the Director, it is meant to run on a VR headset.

### Install
The User app is distributed as an Android application package, or APK file.

First, ensure your Quest headset is in Debug Mode. This is configured through the Meta Quest app on a smartphone.

Next, connect your headset to a PC via USB, and launch the provided APK Installer.

Finally, open the Spatial Media User APK file in the APK Installer, and wait for the installation to finish.

> **WARNING**:
> Only one role can be installed on a given VR headset. Installing the User role will overwrite the Director role, and vice-versa.

### Startup
The Spatial Media User app can be found in the App Library, under the "Unknown Apps" section on the Quest headset.

Like with other Spatial Media roles, enter the IP address of the Server machine into the Network prompt, and connection should be established automatically.
