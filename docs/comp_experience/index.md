Spatial Media is a distributed broadcast studio based on a client/server architecture.

### Where does it fit in TRANSMIXR?
The Spatial Media XR Experience package provides tools to broadcast immersive media in the context of a live TV broadcast on a virtual stage

### What problems does it solve?
1. Display immersive content (360, volumetric)
2. Manage a familiar live broadcast environment for VR
3. Allow spectators to communicate with each other and react live

### How does it work?
The broadcast is transferred over the Internet through two communication channels: Control (WebSockets) and Data (WebRTC)

Spatial Media is broadly split into five software apps, hereafter referred to as "roles". A complete broadcast leveraging all features will require all roles to be up and running. Some roles may require third-party software to be running alongside them in order to function.

Below are instructions to set up and connect each role on a local network. These instructions assume a simplified topology, where each role is given to a different machine, and all machines are connected to the same network.
