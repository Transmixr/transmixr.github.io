The Director is one of two roles running on a VR headset, and is responsible for monitoring and controlling live aspects of the broadcast.

### Install
The Director app is distributed as an Android application package, or APK file.

First, ensure your Quest headset is in Debug Mode. This is configured through the Meta Quest app on a smartphone.

Next, connect your headset to a PC via USB, and launch the provided APK Installer.

Finally, open the Spatial Media Director APK file in the APK Installer, and wait for the installation to finish.

### Startup
The Spatial Media Director app can be found in the App Library, under the "Unknown Apps" section on the Quest headset.

Like with other Spatial Media roles, enter the IP address of the Server machine into the Network prompt, and connection should be established automatically.
