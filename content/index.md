Home of the **technical documentation** of the [TRANSMIXR EU research project](https://transmixr.eu/).

TRANSMIXR's goal is to develop tools and services that help **transform the media landscape**
through the innovative use of **AI and XR technologies**. This website provides
the technical details of the components driving these tools, inviting developers
and XR inspired communities and individuals to try out and contribute to these
tools.

There are three aspects of XR technology covered by the project TRANSMIXR:

- [CREATE Co-create Immersive Media Experiences](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/)
