# Components - Creation

## Introduction

The second set of components build by the TRANSMIXR project revolve around the **co-creation of immersive media experiences**:

* Collaborative VR tools: Work together with others in virtual reality to create amazing media. Easy-to-use tools: No technical skills required. Our tools make it simple to build and share your creations.
* Mix and match media: Combine different types of media to create unique and engaging experiences.
* Share your creations: Easily share your work with the world.
* Virtual Production Studio: Capture live performances and bring stories to life in XR with our live studio tools.

We present and document herein a set of technical components for capture-based media creation:
1. [Volumetric Content Toolbox](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/volumetric_content_toolbox/) -- Transform camera capture into static volumetric images.
2. [Volcap](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/volumetric_studio/) -- Workflows for streaming and offline capture of volumetric video.
3. [Template-based Authoring](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/template_based_authoring/) -- Choose from a wide set of interaction and object templates to efficiently and easily jump-start the creation of XR scenarios.
4. [VR2Gather](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/vr2gather/) -- a Unity package to allow creating immersive social VR applications in Unity.
5. [SenseXR](https://transmixr.github.io/comp_creation/sense_xr/) -- enables the ongoing capture of multiple capture streams while the user is interacting with the application, without impacting performance, directly from within the game engine.
