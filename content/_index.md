Home of the **technical documentation** of the [TRANSMIXR EU research project](https://transmixr.eu/).

TRANSMIXR's goal is to develop tools and services that help **transform the media landscape**
through the innovative use of **AI and XR technologies**. This website provides
the technical details of the components driving these tools, inviting developers
and XR inspired communities and individuals to try out and contribute to these
tools.

There are three aspects of XR technology covered by the TRANSMIXR project:

- [**Comprehend:** Making Sense of Media](/media-understanding)
- [**Create:** Co-create Immersive Media Experiences](/creation)
- [**Immersive Experiences:** Sharing and Experiencing XR](/immersive-experiences)

The TRANSMIXR Platform is a set of publicly accessible APIs and software
components facilitating XR experiences. It has been developed following a
bottom-up approach, ensuring that users and stakeholders are the true drivers
and that the components meets their needs. The components have been validated
in four use cases: Newsroom of the Future: Newsroom toolbox (for news media
journalists); Newsroom of the Future: TV Pilot Program (for news broadcast);
CAI (for performing arts); and Data-driven Immersive Storytelling Format for
the Cultural Heritage Sector (for cultural heritage).Each of the use cases
validates and uses a subset of all the components, thus demonstrating the
reusability and interoperability between them and evaluating the drawbacks and
benefits of each one of them. Below, it is the mapping between use cases and
technology components.
